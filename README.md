# Opticare

### Description

This React Native application was developed to enhance the in-store experience at Saikrupa Optical (Karad, India). The business was going through a technology upgradation process to enhance customer engagement through in-store devices that allow customers to browse the entire range of products, try various frame and lens configurations, and get an accurate estimate of the overall price. The company also desired to go paperless by digitizing key information about sales history, customer records etc.
Opticare enables both customers and sales staff to efficiently navigate product offerings and enjoy a seamless digital shopping experience. Built using React Native and powered by Supabase, the app is provides features such as real-time inventory management, modular product pricing, cart functionality, and order tracking
